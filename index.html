<h3 style="text-decoration:underline">Quick Overview</h3>
    <p>New Orleans, also known as "The Big Easy", is world-renowned for its boisterous music, unique food, beautiful cemeteries, and its non-stop flow of celebrations and festivals, most notably Mardi Gras. Located at the "toe" of the boot that is Louisiana, you would be strapped to find a quiet place to stay. Millions are known for traveling anualy for tourism alone, and when "The Big Easy" is known for being a more "open" people who are in the LGBTQA+ community in the south, it's not to hard to see why.
<h3 style="text-decoration:underline">Festivals</h3>
      The New Orleans area is home to numerous annual celebrations. The most well known is Carnival, or Mardi Gras, but some of the "smaller" festavals such as Jazz fest, Voodoo fest, and Essence Music Festival are always a blast to go to. Other major festivals include Southern Decadence, the French Quarter Festival, and the Tennessee Williams/New Orleans Literary Festival. The American playwright lived and wrote in New Orleans early in his career, and set his play, Streetcar Named Desire, there.
<h3 style="text-decoration:underline">Film and Music</h3>
      Films were produced in and around the city include Ray, Runaway Jury, The Pelican Brief, Glory Road, All the King's Men, Déjà Vu, Last Holiday, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, 12 Years a Slave, and Project Power. In 2006, work began on the Louisiana Film & Television studio complex, based in the Tremé neighborhood. Louisiana began to offer similar tax incentives for music and theater productions in 2007, and some commentators began to refer to New Orleans as "Broadway South."
<h3 style="text-decoration:underline">Food</h3>    
    The indigenous cuisine is distinctive and influential, getting those influences from local ingredients, French, Spanish, Italian, African, Cajun, and a hint of Cuban traditions combine to create the easily recognizable New Orleans flavor. A personal favorite of mine is the beignets, always making me think of "The Princess and The Frog" Disney movie. 
<h3 style="text-decoration:underline">Sports</h3> 
    Each year New Orleans plays host to the Sugar Bowl, the New Orleans Bowl and the Zurich Classic, a golf tournament on the PGA Tour.New Orleans' professional sports teams include the New Orleans Saints and the New Orleans Pelicans. It is also home to the Big Easy Rollergirls, an all-female flat track roller derby team, and the New Orleans Blaze, a women's football team.  
<h3 style="text-decoration:underline">Architecture</h3>
    Though possessing numerous structures of national architectural significance, it is equally, if not more, revered for its enormous, largely intact (even post-Katrina) historic built environment. New Orleans is world-famous for its abundance of architectural styles that reflect the city's multicultural heritage. Its mansions are in various styles, such as Greek Revival, American Colonial and the Victorian styles of Queen Anne and Italianate architecture.
